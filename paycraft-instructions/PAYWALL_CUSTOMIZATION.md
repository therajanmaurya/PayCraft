# PAYWALL_CUSTOMIZATION.md — the two supported paywall paths

> Consumed by `/idea-paycraft` chain step 6. Authored by `/paycraft-corpus-fold`.

There are exactly **two** supported ways to ship a paywall. Both are first-class; a consumer picks one
per app. There is no third "partially custom" path — mixing PayCraft rendering with hand-rolled
surface ownership is what produced the blank-background class of bug.

---

## Path A — cloud-rendered (bundled composables)

The host renders a PayCraft composable; everything visual comes from `SuiteConfig.paywall`
(`PaywallDto`) so a dashboard change reaches the app on the next `/config` fetch with no release.

**Entry points**

| Composable | Surface | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `PayCraftPaywall(…)` | full screen | the paywall is a destination |
| `PayCraftPaywallSheet(…)` | modal bottom sheet | the paywall interrupts a flow |
| `PayCraftSheet(visible, onDismiss, modifier)` | sheet wrapper | simplest drop-in |
| `PayCraftPaywallWithRestore(onDismiss, modifier)` | screen | paywall + restore in one surface |
| `PayCraftBanner` / `PayCraftInlinePaywallBanner` / `BannerPaywall` | inline | contextual upsell |
| `PayCraftPremiumBanner` | inline | already-premium state |
| `PayCraftPremiumGuard` / `PayCraftPremiumGuardInline` | wrapper | gate a screen or a region |
| `PayCraftRestore` / `PayCraftRestoreContent` | screen / content | restore purchases |
| `PayCraftCheckoutSuccessSheet` / `…OrPaywall` | sheet | post-purchase confirmation |
| `ProductList(…)` | list | plan stack on its own |

### What actually renders: one state machine + a component tree

The four Kotlin templates (`BrandedStackTemplate`, `MinimalTemplate`, `DarkTemplate`,
`PremiumTemplate`) **are gone**. Each of them owned a `when (state)` over every `BillingState` arm,
and six of those arms were effectively identical across all four — Loading was the same skeleton,
PaymentPending / DeviceConflict / OwnershipVerified already delegated to the same shared components,
Premium and Error differed only in wording no tenant chose and none could change. Only the **Free**
arm genuinely varied, and that is precisely the part a component tree expresses.

So the four templates were one state machine plus four layouts, and each half now lives once:

- **The state machine** is `PaywallStateHost(state, workflow, context)` — the single `when
  (BillingState)`, shared by every surface.
- **The layouts** are component trees: `PaywallWorkflow` → `PaywallStep` → `PaywallNode`.

**Resolution order, decided in `PayCraftPaywallComposable` (not inside a template — the question is
*which renderer*, not *how this template draws*):**

```
config.paywall.workflow   (tenant's PUBLISHED tree, JsonElement)
  └─ parse fails or absent →  BuiltInPaywallSeeds.workflow(template)   (bundled seed JSON)
        └─ both null → the error surface with a retry, never a blank sheet
```

`PaywallDto.template` is therefore a **seed selection**, not a second rendering path. A tenant who
published a tree is unaffected; one who never did gets the same design, rendered by the renderer
instead of by a hand-written twin. `PaywallTemplate.{MINIMAL,PREMIUM,DARK}` remain as `@Deprecated`
seed names (removal in cmp-paycraft 3.0.0); `BRANDED_STACK` is the default and `parse()` falls back
to it for any unknown value.

### The tree contract

```kotlin
data class PaywallWorkflow(
    schemaVersion: Int, initialStepId: String, steps: List<PaywallStep>,
    localizations: Map<String, Map<String, String>>, colorScheme: String = "light",
)
data class PaywallStep(id, name, isLastStep, root: PaywallNode?)
```

`PaywallNode` variants: `Stack` (axis/spacing/padding/margin/background/corner/border),
`Text(textLid, …)`, `Image`, `Icon`, `Package(roleIdentifier, isSelectedByDefault, stack)`,
`Button(labelLid, action)`, `PurchaseButton`, `RestorePurchases`, `Footer(sticky)`,
`Timeline`/`TimelineItem`, `Spacer`, and `Unknown(type)`.

Four properties of this design are load-bearing, and each exists because of a specific failure:

1. **`workflow` is carried as `JsonElement`, not a typed model.** The SDK must survive receiving a
   *newer* tree than it understands. kotlinx would reject an unknown node shape at deserialization
   and take the **whole config** down with it; `PaywallTreeParser` walks it leniently and degrades
   node-by-node to `Unknown`. Config decoding is the wrong place to be strict. `SUPPORTED_SCHEMA_VERSION`
   is **2**, and `isForwardVersion` tells a caller it is looking at a newer tree.
2. **The field is nullable and additive on purpose.** Every already-released SDK ignores it, and a
   tenant with no published tree gets `null` — so there is no coordinated rollout and no version
   negotiation. `/config` sources it from `published_workflow` only; a draft can never arrive.
3. **Copy carries variables; the renderer does not draw prices.** Price used to be an *overlay* the
   renderer positioned in a corner of every package card — so a card with a short authored stack
   rendered its price **outside** its own background and border (obvious the moment a selected-state
   ring was drawn), and price placement was the one thing a tenant could not move. Now a `text` node
   whose lid resolves to `{{ product.price }}` sits wherever the author put it, inheriting the card's
   layout and clipping. The closed set is `product.price`, `product.price_per_period`,
   `product.offer_savings`, `product.offer_savings_label`; an unknown variable resolves to **empty**,
   never to its own braces — a typo must not print `{{ product.whatver }}` at a paying customer, so
   it is caught upstream by the dashboard's closed list and the seed test instead.
4. **Seeds fail to a null, not an exception.** A missing or malformed bundled asset returns null so
   the caller can fall back. This is the surface where a crash costs a subscription, and the SDK has
   been bitten once already by a bundled-asset path throwing from a static initializer.

> **The device-only regex bug, kept as a warning.** `PaywallVariables`' pattern escapes both braces
> on **both** sides. The JVM's `java.util.regex` accepts a bare `}` as a literal, so the unescaped
> form compiled and **416 JVM tests passed**; Android's stricter engine threw `PatternSyntaxException`
> from a **static initializer**, i.e. `ExceptionInInitializerError` the first time any paywall
> rendered — the app died opening the paywall. Found only on a device. JVM-green is not a paywall
> verdict.

### `RenderContext` — what the tree is rendered against

`RenderContext(locale, hasIntroOffer, selectedPackageRole, availableRoles)`.

`availableRoles` filters the tree's package roles down to the ones this tenant's catalogue can
actually price — a tree may author more plans than a given tenant sells, and the unsold ones should
not sit inert on the paywall. **It is never allowed to be empty**: an empty filter hides every plan,
which leaves a headline, a CTA and nothing to buy. If nothing resolves, showing the authored plans
beats showing none — worst case a price is missing, versus no way to subscribe at all. (A genuinely
empty catalogue is a separate, earlier branch.)

The tree's authored default selection (`Package.isSelectedByDefault`) is applied **once**, through
the same `SelectPlan` action the user's taps use — never by styling the card — so what is *ringed*
and what `Continue` *buys* can never disagree. It is read from the **effective** workflow, not the
tenant's tree alone: reading `treeWorkflow` only was written before seeds became the render path, and
on a real app with no published tree (cappy) it silently did nothing.

**Theme + copy from cloud** — `effectiveThemeOverride` merges `themeJsonb` with the dedicated
`primaryColor` column, and `primary_color` is authoritative. The dashboard's Paywall designer writes
the brand colour into its own column, **not** into `theme_jsonb`; without the merge the brand colour
silently drops and the paywall inherits the host app's MaterialTheme primary.

Also cloud-driven: `heroTitle`, `heroSubtitle`, `valueProps[]`, `ctaContinue`, `ctaGetPremium`,
`restoreLabel`, `termsUrl`, `privacyUrl`, `popularPlanSku`, `successTitle`/`successMessage`/
`successCtaLabel`, `heroIconSvg`, `supportEmail`, `branding`, `customFooter`, and the
**trial-disclosure** trio `trialTermsTemplate` / `trialDisclosureTitle` / `trialDisclosureBody`
(Play Subscriptions policy requires the paywall to state trial length, post-trial price + cadence,
and how to cancel; `{days}` and `{price}` are substituted at render, and a blank value falls back to
the SDK's localized default so an old tenant row stays compliant).

### The surface-mode contract (the blank-background fix)

`PayCraftSurfaceMode` decides **who owns bounds and background**. Exactly one layer paints.

```kotlin
enum class PayCraftSurfaceMode { FullScreen, Sheet }
val LocalPayCraftSurfaceMode = staticCompositionLocalOf { PayCraftSurfaceMode.FullScreen }

@Composable @ReadOnlyComposable
fun Modifier.paywallRoot(background: Color): Modifier      // FullScreen: fillMaxSize + background
                                                            // Sheet:      fillMaxWidth only
@Composable @ReadOnlyComposable
fun Modifier.paywallContentSize(): Modifier                 // sizing-only variant, no paint
```

A paywall inside a `ModalBottomSheet` sits in a slot the sheet already sizes, shapes, colours and
scrims. If the paywall *also* declares `fillMaxSize()` and paints an opaque background, it expands
the sheet to the full window and covers the scrim — the host disappears and the "sheet" reads as an
opaque takeover. `PayCraftPaywallSheet` provides `Sheet`; `PayCraftPaywall` provides `FullScreen`;
the default is `FullScreen` so a tree rendered standalone (previews, screenshot tests) keeps its
self-painting behaviour.

**Rules for anyone authoring a tree or embedding a surface:**

1. Never write a bare `fillMaxSize().background(x)` at a paywall root — use `Modifier.paywallRoot(x)`.
2. Never write a bare `fillMaxSize()` on an inner scroll column — use `Modifier.paywallContentSize()`;
   a full-height scroll column forces the sheet open just as a painted root does.
3. Never nest a PayCraft sheet composable inside another modal sheet.
4. A host that supplies its own container must provide `LocalPayCraftSurfaceMode = Sheet`.

**Verification (device-truth):** a sheet paywall is correct when a fresh capture, taken after
`am force-stop`, shows host content visible above the sheet with the scrim between them. A
screenshot showing an opaque full-window paywall is a failure even if the composable tree compiles.

### Config-resilience surfaces

`ConfigUnavailable(...)`, `PlansUnavailable(onDismiss)` and `StaleConfigNotice(ageSeconds, onRetry)`
render the `ConfigResult` arms (PUBLIC_API.md). Use them rather than an indefinite spinner: the whole
point of `configResultFlow` is that "loading", "offline", and "this is last week's cache" are
different things to say to a buyer, and only one of them deserves a retry button.

---

## Path B — generated bespoke UI against the headless surface

The app owns every pixel and consumes only `BillingManager`. Nothing from
`com.mobilebytelabs.paycraft.ui` or `.presentation` is imported.

**Minimum contract a bespoke paywall must satisfy** — this is what `/idea-paycraft` asserts, and each
item is a real failure mode, not a style preference:

| # | Requirement | Why |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | Render every `BillingState` arm, including `PaymentPending`, `DeviceConflict`, `OwnershipVerified` | Unhandled arms render as a blank or wrong screen |
| B2 | `PaymentPending` shows a "payment processing" surface with **no retry affordance** | A retry button here is the duplicate-purchase bug |
| B3 | Buy CTA calls `purchaseViaPlayBilling` / `purchaseViaStoreKit` per platform, never a browser URL | Store anti-steering policy |
| B4 | A visible **Restore** action calling the restore path | Both stores require it |
| B5 | Terms and Privacy links wired to `PaywallDto.termsUrl`/`privacyUrl` | Store review requirement; empty lambdas were a real shipped defect |
| B6 | Prices rendered from resolved/native display price, not hardcoded | Wrong currency in other storefronts |
| B7 | Trial copy driven by `isInTrial`/`trialEndsAt`, and CTA suppressed when `checkTrialEligibility()` is false | Offering a consumed trial misleads repeat users |
| B8 | `subscriptionActivated` collected from a scope that outlives checkout | Replay is 0 — a late collector misses the event |
| B9 | Every interactive element reachable and non-dead | `onClick = { }` is a shipped-stub failure |
| B10 | Trial disclosure states length, post-trial price + cadence, and how to cancel | Play Subscriptions policy — the bundled path gets this from `PaywallDto`; a bespoke one must render it itself |

**Prices.** Prefer the native display price (`NativeBillingClient.nativeDisplayPrice`) on Android/iOS
so the buyer sees exactly what the store will charge; fall back to `ProductDto.resolvedPrice`, then to
`basePriceCents`/`baseCurrency`.

---

## Choosing a path

Cloud-rendered is the default: it is dashboard-updatable without an app release and already satisfies
B1–B10. Choose bespoke when the paywall must match a bespoke design system — noting that the
component tree has absorbed much of what used to force that choice, since a tenant can now move,
restyle and re-order the Free arm without an app update. `/idea-paycraft` detects which path an app is
on by whether it imports `com.mobilebytelabs.paycraft.ui`, and verifies that path's assertions only —
per-path, never cross-inherited.
