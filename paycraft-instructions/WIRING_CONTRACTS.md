# WIRING_CONTRACTS.md — DI, initialization order, and the repository seam

> Consumed by `/idea-paycraft` chain step 5 (client wiring). Authored by `/paycraft-corpus-fold`.

## The one initialization order that works

```
1. PayCraft.initialize(apiKey, backend, options, mode)     // synchronous; captures apiKey + backend
2. startKoin { modules(PayCraftModule, …app modules) }     // or add PayCraftModule to an existing startKoin
3. (Android only, optional) loadKoinModules(paycraftPlayBillingModule(context, activityProvider))
4. app UI composes; BillingManager resolves lazily
```

**Why this order is preferred.** `PayCraftModule`'s `SupabaseClient` singleton reads
`PayCraft.backend`, and its `PayCraftService` singleton reads `PayCraft.apiKey` — both set
synchronously inside `initialize`. Neither calls `requireConfig()`, because `config` is only fully
populated after the async `/config` fetch resolves, which happens later than Koin's lazy singleton
materialization. So: `initialize` before `startKoin`, and never gate Koin startup on the config
arriving.

**Why it is no longer fatal to get it wrong.** `PayCraftServiceImpl.apiKey` is now **nullable** where
it used to `error(...)`. That `error` made the SDK's initialization order the *host's* problem: any
DI graph materializing `BillingManager` before `PayCraft.initialize()` crashed the app at start-up
with *"PayCraft.initialize(apiKey) must be called before resolving PayCraftService"*. Hosts do not
control when their container resolves a singleton — a generated logout registry that eagerly touches
every store is enough to lose that race, which is exactly how it was hit on device (cappy, CPH2423).
An unconfigured service now omits the key, the RPCs resolve no tenant, and the answer is a **Free
entitlement** — the correct answer for an app with no key. Ask `PayCraft.isConfigured` when a caller
genuinely needs to know; **do not** re-implement that predicate by reading your own build config.

## commonMain-first (hard)

`PayCraft.initialize` and the Koin wiring belong in the **shared** `commonMain` app-init seam
(`initKoin` in `cmp-shared` for a kmp-project-template fork), not in an Android `Application`
subclass or an iOS `AppDelegate`. A per-platform init means iOS/desktop/web silently run without
billing and the defect only shows up on the platform nobody tested.

Platform-specific pieces are additive Koin modules layered on top, never a second `initialize`.

## What `PayCraftModule` provides

| Binding | Implementation | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SupabaseClient` (qualifier `named("paycraft")`) | `createSupabaseClient` with `Postgrest`, `Auth`, `Realtime` | Qualified — it will not collide with the app's own `SupabaseClient` |
| `PayCraftService` | `PayCraftServiceImpl(client, apiKey = PayCraft.apiKey)` | RPC seam; `apiKey` nullable by design (above) |
| `PayCraftStore` | `PayCraftSettingsStore()` | Email + subscription cache (multiplatform-settings) |
| `PayCraftRealtime` | wraps the qualified `SupabaseClient` | Broadcast invalidation pings |
| `NativeBillingClient` | `platformDefaultNativeBillingClient() ?: WebCheckoutNativeBillingClient()` | Android **and iOS** resolve a real client automatically |
| `EntitlementCache` | `EntitlementCache(service, SettingsEntitlementDao())` | Store5 read-through + offline last-known-good |
| `EntitlementRepository` | `EntitlementRepository(cache, native, service)` | The internal read seam — NOT what a consumer injects |
| `PayCraftRepository` | `PayCraftRepositoryImpl(billing = get(), entitlements = get())` | **The one binding a consumer app injects** (PUBLIC_API.md) |
| `BillingManager` | `PayCraftBillingManager(service, store, repo, nativeBillingClient)` | The headless surface |
| `ConfigCache` | `ConfigCache(Settings())` | Persistent `SuiteConfig` cache — what makes a cold/offline start render real products |
| `HttpClient` | Ktor + `ContentNegotiation(json)` | |
| `CouponClient` | | |
| `PayCraftPaywallViewModel` | `viewModelOf` | Only needed by the bundled paywall |

**The qualifier matters.** Because the `SupabaseClient` is registered under
`named("paycraft")`, an app that already binds its own unqualified `SupabaseClient` keeps it. Do not
"simplify" by dropping the qualifier — that is how a consumer's auth session ends up on PayCraft's
project (or vice versa).

## `NativeBillingClient` — the platform seam

`platformDefaultNativeBillingClient()` is an `expect`/`actual`, and **both native stores now resolve
a real client with zero platform wiring**:

- **Android** → real Google Play Billing (library **9.1.0**). Context and Activity are captured
  automatically by `PayCraftInitializer` (androidx-startup), so a `commonMain`-only consumer needs no
  androidMain code.
- **iOS** → real StoreKit 2 (`StoreKit2NativeBillingClient`), **always**. This previously returned
  null (later an `UnconfiguredStoreKitClient`) because the Swift bridge could only come from the
  consuming app, so iOS integrators had to copy `PayCraftStoreKit2.swift` into their Xcode target and
  load `paycraftStoreKit2BillingModule` by hand. **The shim is now SDK-internal** — compiled to a
  static archive and reached via cinterop — so there is nothing to inject and no way to be
  "unconfigured". `PayCraft.initialize(apiKey)` in commonMain is the whole iOS integration, exactly
  as it already was on Android. **`paycraftStoreKit2BillingModule` no longer exists; a wiring that
  still loads it will not compile.**
- **desktop / web / js** → returns null, and the module falls back to `WebCheckoutNativeBillingClient`
  (a no-op that reports `Web`), which is correct: those platforms have no native store.

The one remaining opt-in override, loaded **after** `PayCraftModule`:

- `paycraftPlayBillingModule(context, activityProvider)` (Android) — only when the app needs a custom
  `activityProvider`. The default path does not need it.

If a native-store platform somehow resolves `WebCheckoutNativeBillingClient`, every digital checkout
resolves to `CheckoutLane.Misconfigured` and is **blocked**, not silently redirected to a browser.

## `tenantId` lifecycle

`tenantId` is **server-assigned**, arrives on `SuiteConfig.tenantId`, and is never configured by the
client. It is null-equivalent until the first config lands (cached or fetched), so:

- Realtime subscription is deferred until `suiteConfig?.tenantId` is non-null. Channels are
  `config:{tenantId}` and `entitlement:{tenantId}:{appUserId}`.
- `appUserId` is the lowercased trimmed email when known, else `PayCraft.deviceId`. When identity
  flips from device-id to email (`registerAndLogin`), the entitlement channel **re-subscribes** —
  a wiring that skips that re-subscribe leaves realtime pointed at the anonymous channel forever.
- `PayCraftRealtime.resubscribe()` on app foreground; `stop()` on logout/teardown. The liveness
  check is on the channel's actual subscribed status, not on `channel != null` (a dead channel stays
  non-null and silently stops delivering).

## The repository seam

Two layers, and a consumer binds only the outer one.

**`PayCraftRepository` — what the app injects.** `PayCraftRepositoryImpl` composes `BillingManager`
+ `EntitlementRepository` + `PayCraft.suiteConfigFlow`, exposing `isPremium` / `entitlement` /
`plans` / `checkout` / `restore` / `manageSubscription` / `refresh`. **A consumer app writes no
repository, store, or API wrapper of its own** — doing so is the 670 LOC (measured on `mbs/cappy`:
five modules, `PayCraftApiImpl` alone 233 lines over 12 SDK call sites) that this binding deletes.
Gate UI on `entitlement` (which preserves tier across `Loading`/`PaymentPending`/`Error`) rather
than on `billingState`.

**`EntitlementRepository(cache, native, service)` — internal.** The single place read paths
converge: Store5 `EntitlementCache` for read-through + offline truth, `NativeBillingClient` for
store-side purchases/restore, `PayCraftService` for server truth. It threads an `appUserId` and
speaks `StoreReadResponse<Entitlement>`; that is the plumbing the facade hides, so do not reach
past the facade into it — and never into the cache.

For tests and `@Preview`s, inject `FakePayCraftRepository` (it ships in the MAIN artifact, so it
reaches `commonTest` with no extra wiring).

## Verification an integrator can run

- `PayCraft.apiKey` non-null immediately after `initialize` (synchronous capture), and
  `PayCraft.isConfigured == true`.
- `getKoin().get<PayCraftRepository>()` resolves without throwing, and `isPremium` / `entitlement`
  emit immediately (Free before the first read, never empty).
- `getKoin().get<BillingManager>()` resolves without throwing — **including before `initialize`**,
  where it must answer Free rather than crash.
- `getKoin().get<NativeBillingClient>()` is NOT `WebCheckoutNativeBillingClient` on Android/iOS when
  the app ships digital subscriptions.
- `PayCraft.suiteConfigFlow.value?.tenantId` non-null after the first successful `/config`, and
  `PayCraft.configResultFlow.value` is `Fresh`/`Cached` rather than `Failed`.
