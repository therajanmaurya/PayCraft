/**
 * UI-facing plan model derived from a cloud-resolved [com.mobilebytelabs.paycraft.config.ProductDto].
 *
 * @property price          The price the customer actually pays. When a promotional
 *                          discount or applied coupon is in effect this is the
 *                          POST-discount amount — callers don't need to do math.
 * @property originalPrice  The pre-discount amount, formatted in the same currency
 *                          as [price]. `null` when no discount is active. The paywall
 *                          renders it strike-through above [price] when present.
 * @property discountPercent The active discount percentage (1..99). `null` when no
 *                          discount applies. Drives the "X% OFF" badge.
 * @property discountEndsAt ISO-8601 timestamp when the discount expires.
 *                          `null` = no expiry. The paywall uses this for a countdown.
 * @property trialDays      Free-trial length in days, or `null` if no trial.
