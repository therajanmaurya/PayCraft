/**
 * THE single deciding point for currency/country across the SDK.
 *
 * Why this exists: previously the country defaulted to a hardcoded "US" (device region was
 * never read), the currency lived implicitly on each [BillingPlan], and every provider's
 * checkout-URL lookup did its OWN `plan.currency → USD → first` fallback — so the paywall
 * could display ₹/INR while one provider routed checkout in USD, and two providers could
 * disagree. Centralizing the decision here guarantees price + all providers stay consistent.
 *
 * Resolution model:
 *  1. [resolveCountry] picks the country ONCE (override → store storefront → device → cloud
 *     locale → "US").
 *  2. The country is sent to `/config`, which returns per-locale prices; [resolveCurrency]
 *     reads back the single currency the cloud resolved for that locale.
 *  3. [checkoutCurrency] picks each provider's checkout-link currency from that ONE active
 *     currency with a deterministic shared fallback — identical for every provider.

     *
     * The store storefront is the region the user's Play/Apple PAYMENT ACCOUNT lives in — the true
     * billing region — so it wins over the device UI locale. An India buyer whose phone language is
     * en-GB has an "IN" storefront and a "GB" device country; storefront-first resolves to "IN" so
     * the paywall and every provider bill in ₹/INR, not £/GBP.
