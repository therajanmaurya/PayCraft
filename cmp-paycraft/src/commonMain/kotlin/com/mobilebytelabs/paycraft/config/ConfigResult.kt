/**
 * The outcome of a config load, replacing the `SuiteConfig?` that four different situations used to
 * share.
 *
 * WHY A SEALED TYPE RATHER THAN A NULLABLE
 * `PayCraftPaywallComposable.kt:351` gates its skeleton on `config == null`, and null meant all of:
 * never fetched, fetch in flight, fetch returned HTTP 500, and device is offline. Three of those are
 * terminal and one is transient, but the UI cannot tell them apart, so it renders the same spinner
 * forever. On steady that spinner is in front of onboarding with a no-op dismiss, which strands an
 * offline user inside a shipped app.
 *
 * Each variant below answers a question the UI actually needs to ask: is there something to show,
 * how much should the user trust it, and is a retry worth offering.
