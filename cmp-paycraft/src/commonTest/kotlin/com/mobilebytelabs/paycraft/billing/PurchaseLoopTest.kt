/**
 * Contract tests for the Phase-2 purchase loop (PB-1, PB-2, PB-3, PB-7, SK-2, SK-3, SK-6).
 *
 * These pin the SHAPE of the contract the store adapters must honour — the parts that are
 * platform-independent and therefore testable without Play or StoreKit:
 *
 *  - a pending purchase is its own outcome, never a failure and never an entitlement;
 *  - identity reaches the store on every purchase;
 *  - the store is told a purchase is finished ONLY after the caller says so;
 *  - out-of-band purchases have a delivery path that exists whether or not anyone is purchasing.
 *
 * The Play/StoreKit adapters are exercised on-device; what regresses silently is the contract, and
 * that is what these hold.
