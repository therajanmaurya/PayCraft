 * is immutable once active". That is true of CHANGING an existing region's price on an active plan
 * (which needs Play's price-change flow); it is NOT true of ADDING a region, which is an ordinary
 * `subscriptions.patch`. Verified against the live API: a plan went 1 → 7 regions and stayed ACTIVE.
 *
 * The consequence of the old behaviour was silent and permanent. The cappy subscriptions were
 * created when only USD was configured, so they were pinned to a single region (US) forever; the
 * operator later configured seven currencies and Play kept selling in one country, with every sync
 * reporting success. It is the same self-perpetuating shape as the App Store pricing bug: the state
 * created by the first run is what convinces every later run there is nothing to do.
 *
 * Existing regionalConfigs are copied through untouched, so no price is ever rewritten and the
 * constrained operation is never attempted.
