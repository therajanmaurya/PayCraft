/**
 * Drift detectors — reconcile, not flag-drain.
 *
 * Each detector READS the real state and diffs it against what PayCraft believes, so the badge
 * reflects what actually diverged rather than what someone remembered to flag. A drain over
 * `sync_status='pending'` was rejected for a measurable reason: on cappy it would have reported
 * all-green while the paywall row did not exist and Razorpay had zero payment links — every product
 * read `synced`, and the app could not be sold in INR at all.
 *
 * The five classes are not a taxonomy invented for completeness. Each is a defect measured on
 * production during the 2026-09-15 session:
 *
 *   1 product-missing-at-provider  — `cappy_plus_guardian` shared a `tenant_packages` row with
 *                                    monthly, so no component-tree node could address it
 *   2 paywall-not-published        — cappy had no `tenant_paywall` row; the SDK served bundled copy
 *                                    and a wellness app advertised "HD downloads"
 *   3 credential-mode-mismatch     — Razorpay's LIVE slot held an `rzp_test_` key, no webhook secret
 *   4 active-provider-zero-links   — that same provider was `is_active=true` with zero payment
 *                                    links, so `/config` filtered it out entirely
 *   5 missing-currency-for-country — no INR `tenant_pricing` rows, so IN buyers were quoted USD
 *
 * Two later classes follow the same rule — each is a measured defect, not a category added for
 * symmetry:
 *
 *   6 active-provider-no-credential — a provider switched on and never connected matched neither
 *                                     branch of class 3 and fell through to class 4, whose remedy
 *                                     is a sync that cannot work
 *   7 no-test-credential            — live key present, test key absent (measured on cappy,
 *                                     2026-09-22): sync can only create LIVE products, so a
 *                                     `pk_test_` build resolves no link and the only way to
 *                                     exercise a purchase is with real money
 *
 * Every finding carries an `action_hint`. A finding without one is a complaint rather than a fix,
 * and the operator is left to work out what to do with it.

/**
 * Class 8 — the provider CAN transact in test mode and has live links, but zero TEST links.
 *
 * WHY NO EXISTING DETECTOR SEES THIS
 * `detectActiveProviderZeroLinks` counts `linkCount(live) + linkCount(test)` and returns early on
 * any non-zero total. A provider with three live links and no test links therefore reads as fully
 * synced. `detectNoTestCredential` does not fire either, because the test CREDENTIAL is present —
 * that is its whole precondition. So the one state that actually blocks test mode falls between
 * the two, and did: Stripe on cappy held a test key and three live links, every detector was quiet,
 * and a `pk_test_` build still had no link to open.
 *
 * The remedy is a plain re-sync. `runProductSync` writes every configured mode, so syncing this
 * provider creates the missing test artifacts without touching the live ones.
