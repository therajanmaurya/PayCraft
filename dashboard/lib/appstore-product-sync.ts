 *     per-territory price-point ladder (you cannot POST an arbitrary amount),
 *     so we resolve the CLOSEST price point to the desired base price and set
 *     it only when no price is configured yet.

 * Ensure the subscription is AVAILABLE in the App Store's territories.
 *
 * WHY THIS HAS TO HAPPEN FIRST
 * App Store Connect refuses almost everything else until availability exists. Creating a free-trial
 * introductory offer against a subscription with no availability answers
 * `409 STATE_ERROR: You need to set up availabilities first.` — which is exactly what cappy hit, and
 * which read as "the app is not live" only because the liveness guidance was appended to it. The two
 * are unrelated: availability is a property of the SUBSCRIPTION, and a TestFlight/in-review app can
 * have it set perfectly well.
 *
 * Nothing in this sync ever called this endpoint, so every subscription it created was left in a
 * state where prices and offers could not attach — the subscription existed and could never be sold.
 *
 * ALL territories, with `availableInNewTerritories`. PayCraft prices in 30+ currencies and the
 * paywall is served worldwide, so restricting availability here would silently contradict the
 * catalogue. `availableInNewTerritories: true` also means a storefront Apple adds later is included
 * rather than quietly missing.
 *
 * Idempotent: an existing availability is left alone (Apple treats it as immutable-ish, and
 * re-POSTing conflicts).

 * This function used to create one USD price and stop, on the assumption — written into its own
 * comment — that "Apple auto-derives the rest of the territory ladder from the base price point".
 * That is true of the App Store Connect UI, which equalizes for you as you type. It is NOT true of
 * the API: a price POST creates exactly one row, for exactly one territory.
 *
 * The result was a subscription available in 175 territories and priced in 1, which App Store
 * Connect reports as `MISSING_METADATA` — with no indication of WHICH metadata, and no error from
 * any call, because every individual request succeeded. Worse, the old early-return ("any price
 * exists → done") meant no amount of re-syncing could ever repair it: the single USA row it had
 * just created was proof to the next run that pricing was complete.
 *
 * So the check is coverage: the set of territories the subscription is SOLD in, minus the set it is
 * PRICED in, must be empty. Apple's own `equalizations` endpoint supplies the per-territory price
 * point for a chosen base, so the prices match what the UI would have produced.
