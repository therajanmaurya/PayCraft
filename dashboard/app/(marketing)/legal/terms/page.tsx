      <Section title="2. Service">
        <p>
          PayCraft Cloud is a multi-tenant subscription billing platform that
          routes checkout through Customer-configured payment providers
          (Stripe, Razorpay, etc.) and synchronizes subscription state via
          provider webhooks.

      <Section title="3. Free Tier">
        <p>
          The Free tier permits up to 100 active subscribers, 10,000 webhook
          events per month, 1 connected provider, and 1 product. The free
          tier displays PayCraft attribution in the SDK-rendered paywall.

      <Section title="5. Customer Data">
        <p>
          Customer retains all rights to data submitted to the Service. We
          act as a Data Processor for end-user data (subscribers' emails,
          devices, etc.) and as a Data Controller for Customer's own account
          data (login, billing).
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="6. Acceptable Use">
        <p>
          You may not use the Service for fraudulent transactions, mass
          unsolicited messaging, or to circumvent your payment provider's
          terms. We may suspend tenants that violate these rules.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="7. Termination">
        <p>
          Either party may terminate by ending their subscription. We retain
          tenant data for 30 days post-termination, then delete it
          permanently.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="8. Liability">
        <p>
          Our aggregate liability is limited to the fees Customer paid in
          the 12 months preceding the claim. We are not liable for indirect
          or consequential damages, including lost revenue from payment
          provider downtime.
